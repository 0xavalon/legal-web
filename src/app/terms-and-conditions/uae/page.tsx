          Ethereum. By using the Interface, you understand that you are not
          buying or selling digital assets from us and that we do not operate
          any liquidity pools on the Protocol or control trade execution on the
          Protocol. When traders pay fees for trades, those fees accrue to
          liquidity providers for the Protocol. As a general matter, Wind is not
          a liquidity provider into Protocol liquidity pools and liquidity
          providers are independent third parties. The Protocol was initially
          deployed on the Ethereum blockchain, and has since been deployed on
          several other blockchain networks including by parties other than
          Uniswap Labs. Deployments on other networks typically make use of
          cross-chain bridges, which allow assets native to one blockchain to be
          transferred to another blockchain. Please note that digital assets
          that have been "bridged" or "wrapped" to operate on other blockchain
          networks (including to blockchains compatible with the Ethereum
          Virtual Machine that are designed to ensure the Ethereum blockchain
          can effectively process more transactions or other blockchains that
          are frequently referred to as "Layer 2" solutions such as Polygon) are
          distinct from the original Ethereum mainnet asset.

          To access the Interface, you must use a non-custodial wallet software,
          which allows you to interact with public blockchains. Your
          relationship with that non-custodial wallet provider is governed by
          the applicable terms of service (with respect to the Fin.com Wallet,
          this Agreement, and with respect to a third party wallet, the
          applicable terms of service of such third party). We do not have
          custody or control over the contents of your wallet and have no
          ability to retrieve or transfer its contents. By connecting your
          wallet to our Interface, you agree to be bound by this Agreement and
          all of the terms incorporated herein by reference.
